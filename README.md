# deep-learning-challenge

For this week's challenge we were provided AlphabetSoup application data and were asked to design a neural network to model the Successful column in the data. We were then asked to optomize the model with a minimum of three attempts to achieve the desired accuracy percentage of 75%. My models were unable to achieve that, which is further covered within the other markdown file of this repository.

This repository contains two notebooks. One contains the original model and the other contains my three optimization attempts with the same preprocessing steps. The primary model and best optomized model result outputs are included in the two h5 files.

**Developer Note** At time of submission the h5 files were not working properly on my machine for me to include pictures of them in the analysis markdown file.
